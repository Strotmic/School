As a modern IT professional, you know that managing complex applications can be challenging. Virtualization, Python virtual environments (venv), microservices and DevOps all have their own challenges. Fortunately, there are containerization and orchestration to make managing your applications simpler and scalable.

In this module, we will teach you everything you need to know about containerization & orchestration. We'll start with a solid foundation and explain why Docker is so popular. You'll learn how to design and optimize containers using Dockerfiles. In addition, we'll look at how to make containers work together as services using Docker Compose. And last but not least, we'll teach you how to deploy it at scale with Kubernetes.

As usual, we take a hands-on approach, which is why you'll get lots of hands-on labs that will challenge you! Besides the practical side, we will also provide a theoretical background so you understand what goes on behind the scenes. By attending this module you will learn about the key building blocks suitable for any modern IT application.
