Theory
--------------

- Introduction to data communication: what is data communication, the data communication model, digital vs. analog signals
- Working with logarithmic units: dB and its variants
- Digital communication: parallel/serial, synchronous/asynchronous, synchronization techniques. Operation and signals of SPI, I²C etc. buses.
- Analog communication: properties of EM waves, signals in the time and frequency domain.
- The communication channel: signal to noise ratio, bandwidth, Nyquist and Shannon's theorem and calculation of data transmission capacity.
- Analog-to-digital conversion: continuous vs. discrete time, sampling frequency, bit depth, Nyquist's sampling theorem, aliasing, reconstruction
- Information entropy and compression
- Transmission media and wireless protocols

Lab
-----------

- The student can correctly and safely connect sensors and actuators to the Raspberry Pi
- The student writes efficient and structured code for these devices so that it can be reused in a modular manner.
- The student understands the operation of data communication protocols (including Serial, I²C, SPI, device-specific protocols, ...) and thus exchange data between different devices and the RPi. 
- The student can connect and read an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the RPi and process the obtained analog signals.
- The student can fluently use boolean operators and bit operations.
