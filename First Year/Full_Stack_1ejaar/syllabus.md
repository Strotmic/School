In this module, you can learn how to create and code from A to Z a fully API-driven website.
Since you can choose the Next Web Developer specialization as an undergraduate MCT, you should be able to build complete (full-stack) websites.
In this module, we make a clear split from the beginning between the user-facing side of the website (the front-end) and the side where data is retrieved and processed (the backend).
To program or script both of these sides, we use two programming languages: Javascript for the front-end development and Python for the backend development.
Defining and developing the appearance of the website on the one hand and how to manipulate databases on the other hand will be taught in the User Interface Design and Data Management modules.
Integrating this aforementioned learning we do during the module Full Stack Web Development.

The ultimate goal of this module is to ensure real-time two-way communication between sensors and actuators on your Raspberry Pi as the backend and your home-made website as the frontend.
